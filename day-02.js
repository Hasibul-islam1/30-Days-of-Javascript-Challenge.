// Day 2: Operators
// Tasks/Activities:
// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// • Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let c = a+b;
console.log(c);
// • Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
let d =a-b;
console.log(d);
// • Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let e = a*b;
console.log(e);
// • Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let f=a/b;
console.log(f);
// • Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let g =a%b;
console.log(g);
// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// • Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let h =a+=b;
console.log(h);
let i=10;
console.log(i);
i+=b;
console.log(i);
// • Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let j =30;
j-=b;
console.log(j);
// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// • Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
let k =50;
let l=100;
console.log(k<l);
console.log(k>l);
// • Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
let m=20;
let n =10;
let o=m<=n;
let p=m>=n;
console.log(o);
console.log(p)
// • Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
let name="Hasibul";
let me ="Hasibul";
console.log(name==me);
let roll=2023100010134;
let newRoll="2023100010134";
console.log(roll===newRoll);
// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// • Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
if ((name==me)&&(roll==roll)) {
    console.log(true); //one side is false full condition is false .
} else {
    console.log(false);
}
// • Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
if (k<l||k>l) {
    console.log(true);
} else {
    console.log(false);
}
// • Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// • Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
// Feature Request:
// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
// 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the
// results.
// 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities, students will:
// • Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
// • Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
// • Compare values using comparison operators.
// • Combine conditions using logical operators.
// • Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
